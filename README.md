# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Goals of this statistical modelling project are to obtain data via various APIs, analyse that data and creat models to determine the relationship between the number of bikes in a location and the POIs around iit. 

## Process
##Connect in to various APIs to obtain data
##Add data to dataframes and merge them togeather 
##Visualize data.
##Create regression model 
##Determine conclusion from model
### (your step 2)

## Results
##The R-squared value of 0.014 suggests that only 1.4% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables.
##The F-statistic and its associated p-value of 1.571 and 0.196 respectively, indicate that the overall fit of the model is not statistically significant (p-value ##> 0.05).
##The coefficients of the independent variables indicate the average change in the dependent variable for a one unit increase in the independent variable, holding ##all other independent variables constant. For example, a one unit increase in the "price" variable is associated with an average increase of 0.203 bikes, but ##this relationship is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.176).

## Challenges 
##Getting the data from the APIs. 
##Getting acess to mentors who could trouble shoot my problems. 
##Initially all stations returbed zero available bikes 
##Initially all POIs seemsed to be associated with a single station
##Initially Yelp data returned an error in every other row. 

## Future Goals
##Try other cities to see how the results differ between various cities. Hopefully find results that are statistically significant. 
##Use more data points/variables so I could run the models with more variables
